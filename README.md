# Football Manager API

## Overview
This project is a **Football Manager API**, built with **Spring Boot**, **Hibernate**, and **H2 Database**. It provides RESTful endpoints for managing **football teams and players**, as well as facilitating **player transfers** between teams.

## Features
- CRUD operations for **Teams** and **Players**.
- Player **transfer functionality** with dynamic pricing:
  - Transfer cost = `(Player's experience in months * 100,000) / Player's age in years`
  - Commission (0-10%) applied from the seller's team.
  - The buying team's **balance is reduced**, while the selling team **receives funds**.
- **Validation and error handling** for API requests.
- **Database auto-initialization** using `schema.sql` and `data.sql`.

## Technologies Used
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)**
- **H2 Database (In-Memory)**
- **Jakarta Validation** (for DTO validation)
- **Lombok**
- **MapStruct** (for entity mapping)

## **Database Setup**
This project uses **H2 Database**, which is an in-memory database. The schema and initial data are automatically created using:
- `src/main/resources/schema.sql`
- `src/main/resources/data.sql`

## **Running the Application**
Run the application with a single command:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Alternatively, you can build a JAR and run it:

```sh
mvn clean install
java -jar target/footballmanager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## **Postman Collection**
For testing the API, you can use the provided Postman collection: ðŸ‘‰ [Postman Collection](Replace with actual link)
